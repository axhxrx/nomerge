# Test File With Space

This file contains "no merge" with a space between the words.

Since our configured pattern is "BLOCK_THIS_PR" (and the default is "nomerge" without a space),
this should NOT trigger the action and should be allowed to merge.

Status: no merge - this has a space and should not be blocked!

Additional text: Please do not merge this until review is complete.
We need to ensure no merge conflicts happen.
