# Test File With Space

This file contains "no merge" with a space between the words.

Since our configured pattern is a specific text string (not shown here to avoid triggering),
this should NOT trigger the action and should be allowed to merge.

Status: no merge - this has a space and should not be blocked!

Additional text: Please do not merge this until review is complete.
We need to ensure no merge conflicts happen.

The phrase "no merge" appears multiple times here with spaces, and none should match
the configured forbidden pattern.
