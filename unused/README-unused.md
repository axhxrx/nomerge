# Unused Files

This directory contains files that are no longer needed for the main project but are kept in the repository for historical or reference purposes.

## Contents

### Documentation Files
- **BRANCH_PROTECTION.md** - Historical documentation on setting up branch protection. This information is now included in the action's self-documenting output.
- **PLAN.md** - Original development plan and roadmap. Kept for historical reference.

### Test Files
These were test files used during early development to verify the action's functionality:
- **test-branch-protection.md** - Test file for branch protection verification
- **test-file-001.md** - Initial test file
- **test-with-space.md** - Test file for verifying pattern matching with spaces

## Why Keep These Files?

These files are retained in the repository to:
1. Preserve the development history
2. Provide context for how the project evolved
3. Serve as reference for understanding past decisions
4. Maintain completeness of the git history

## Note

These files are not part of the active codebase and are ignored by the NoMerge action checks.
